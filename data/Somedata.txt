They say absence makes the heart grow fonder, and in this case, I believe it to be true. (Or maybe it’s age.)
But what I can say is that after a decade-plus of not using Microsoft OSes for my personal work, I’m much
happier! As such, I can sit back and safely say, “Sure, feel free to use Windows!” …OK yes, it does make
me grit my teeth to say that.
